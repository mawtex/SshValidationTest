<PackageInfo name="CphCloud.Packages.UrlAlias" groupName="CphCloud" version="1.0.4" author="CPH Cloud Company" website="http://cphcloud.com" description="This package adds a node to the System perspective where users can manage a static datatype (IUrlAlias). Also an HttpModule is registered in Web.Config that intercepts all requests and attemps to find a IUrlAlias that matches the request. If such a match is found, the request is being redirected based on the rules of the IUrlAlias. Note: The installer does not register the Http module in system.web/httpModules and thus will not work in the web server build into Visual Studio (Cassini). Please use IIS Express or add the http module manually.Enables Composite users to easily manage a list of &quot;Url Aliases&quot; that can redirect requests to other pages on the site or to completely different websites. This is useful for making short rememberable urls for pages, for redirecting requests to pages that have been moved or when a url must redirect to a different website." installDate="2018-10-18T20:24:39.3003231+02:00" installedBy="admin" isLocalInstalled="true" canBeUninstalled="true" flushOnCompletion="true" reloadConsoleOnCompletion="true" systemLocking="hard" xmlns="http://www.composite.net/ns/management/packageinstaller/1.0" />
